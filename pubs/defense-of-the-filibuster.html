      <div style="margin-left: 2rem;" class="content">
        <p>In today's political climate, perhaps one of the most hotly contested issues with regards to policymaking procedure is the nature of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster">the Filibuster</a>. In case you aren't familiar with the term, it goes like this: Party X wins a slim majority (51-59 seats) in the Senate. Party X wants to pass Controversial Bill Y. Minority (and opposing) Party Z absolutely does not want Bill Y to pass, and so they invoke a filibuster, a quirk of senate tradition, allowing any member of the Senate to indefinetely delay the voting of a measure by extending the "debating" period. Officially, only <b>51</b> (or a simple majority) seats need to vote YEA to pass a bill through the Senate. BUT, because any one disagreeing senator can filibuster a bill, <b>60</b> (3/5ths of all senators) need to agree to invoke <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloture">cloture</a>- formally ending debate- and allowing a bill to be voted on. So, for any hotly contested debatable measure to make it through the Senate, there effectively needs to be 60 senators at minimum agreeing with the passage of said measure.</p>

        <p>You can see how such a system has become increasingly weaponized in today's divisive political landscape. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211215173438/https://miro.medium.com/max/650/1*7mghjQ26wBFvDtg1jNUFug.jpeg">Mirroring most grievances with tradition</a>, the party with the most to lose as a result of the filibuster (the majority) will always advocate its removal, labeling it an obsolete and unfair tradition serving only to worsen the ever prevalent problem of American legislative gridlock. Conversely, the minority party will endlessly champion the filibuster as an ingenious tradition long enshrined in senate procedure to protect minority rights.</p>

        <p>It is the latter with which I am inclined to agree. My perspective relates to the ideals which I see expressed in the founding values of the United States and the Constitution, most well exemplified in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">The Federalist Papers</a>. The two I feel are most closely related to my argument regarding the filibuster are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10">Federalist 10</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._70">Federalist 70</a>. The specifics sentiments of these two documents I refer to are:
          <p>In No. 10: The role of any well functioning government to prevent rule by faction<sup>1</sup>.</p>
          <p>In No. 70: The necessity of a slow, deliberative legislature which places quality over quantity.</p>
          <small><p><sup>1</sup>I refer to the definition of faction put forth in No. 10 itself, which I think is put best by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_faction#History">this plain english translation in Wikipedia</a>: "A group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good."</p></small>

        <p>James Madison highlights in No. 10 the importance of a government in curbing the powers of political factions. He argues that only a large republic can effectively prevent a faction from grasping the full power of a government, and as such is only possible by creating a landscape so saturated by conflicting factions that no single one is able to usurp the rights and interests of the others just by gaining majority support. These pluralist democratic ideals are one of the many aspects of democracy which are integrated in the foundations of the U.S. government to ensure longevity and comptence in the nation's governance. The filibuster is essentially a direct adherance to these pluralist principles, by requiring more than a simple majority to agree on contested issues, the filibuster ensures that a faction of the majority may not so easily administer its own ideas on a <i>relatively</i> minor, but still largely prevalent, group of people.</p>

        <p>Alexander Hamilton, in an essay more strongly focused on the powers of the executive, also demonstrates in No. 70 that the advantages of a legislative body are not in its ability for quick, decisive action but rather its slower pace and deliberations, in pursuit of a more perfect form of codified law. Hamilton further argues that the powers of decisive and urgent action are better reserved to a unitary executive (the President) than they are to a counsel (many at the time feared the powers which a single head of the executive may have wielded)- but this is beside the point. In an effective legislature, deliberation, discussion, and debate- leading to revisions and improvements of proposed bills- need to take precedence over rapid bill passage. The filibuster helps ensure such a qualitative trait by requiring the Senate to achieve at least some minor form of broad consensus before it can codify proposed legislation.</p>

        <p>It's true, the filibuster has led to an increase in instances of deadlock and inefficiency which plague our modern legislature and its ability to legislate. However, it is easily noticable that while the filibuster has been around for a long, long time, staunch hatred toward it has only grown in recent years. It doesn't take a sleuth's deductive capabilities to see that it's not the filibuster most are really bothered with, but rather the incessent divisiveness we see continuously manifesting in both our culture and our government daily; This divisiveness is the true cause of our legislative- or frankly, political- deadlock. Perhaps we will find more success in alleviating this specific sore by addressing solutions to divisiveness and polarization rather than attempting to devitalize historic safeguards against rule by faction or ineffective legislature.</p>
