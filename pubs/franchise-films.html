        If you haven't been completely detached from the world of entertainment for the past few years, you may have observed the steady rise in popularity that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_series">franchise films</a> have had. None are more popular than the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, which may or may not be officially defined as a "film series", regardless I will continue to refer to it as such.</p>

        <p>I don't like these style of movies. I think they encourage lazy, cliched writing due to the massive amounts of revenue they generate as a result of the commitment to the "mythology" which their audience inevitably develops. Essentially, when you have a following hooked on the world of the story, it is much more acceptable to formulate narratives which, when examined outside of the context of the "cinematic universe", are unbelievably bland and uninspired. What's more, in the case of the MCU, the worldbuilding has the enormous benefit of having an expansive mythology to build on, which follows from the greater than century long history of American comics and The American Superheroâ„¢. The result? Endless opportunities for lazy writing originating from an endless trove of source material to remix and reuse.</p>

        <p>The history of comics and their development over time is so unbelievably rich and much more deep than I can give it credit for here, but that is because I do not mean to be attacking the narritives of <i>comics</i>, but rather their lazy adaptations into broad appeal film. I am no pursuer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_studies">comics studies</a> (a comicologist?), but from what I have gathered from brief reading, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Age_of_Comic_Books">modern age of comics</a> has seen an "enlightenment" of sorts, fostering the rise of self-aware and more serious narratives. I guess it's appropriate we call these "Graphic Novels" ðŸ¤“.</p>

        <p>Jokes aside, I want to reiterate that it takes effort to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding">create an entertaining and convincing world</a>, and I am in no means attacking such efforts or the artform itself. Rather, I am identifying an issue/consequence I see with the adaptation of these fictional worlds into the most powerful storytelling medium, film: the encouragement of lazy writing which generates more buzz out of "What happens to X?!" or "Will we see Y's return in the new Z movie?!" rather than the merits of its writing or its contribution of meaningful thought or innovative style to the world of art/literature.</p>

        <p>These films are only getting more popular, but out of concern of me violating my own convictions against getting too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declinism">declinist</a>, I'll say that if you enjoy these films, continue to watch them, but consider also checking out films which you might have otherwise ignored due to infamiliarity with the genre- which you may find have more to offer.</p>
